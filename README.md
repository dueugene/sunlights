# sunlights

A small raspberry pi project used to control the lights in my room.

It is intended to emulate the daily sunrise and sunset

It uses the open source [hueplusplus](https://github.com/enwi/hueplusplus) library to communicate with the hue lights, and the OpenWeather[https://openweathermap.org/api] api to get the daily sunrise and sunset
